# VO Script

- First Impressions
    - let's start this simple, what first comes to your mind when you see the name "Maisie." It might be Maisie Williams, Maisy mouse or for some, it's just a hard name to spell
    - You've obviously seen me as a student and how i answer? a lot of people say that i'm very straightforward and unfiltered, sometimes bordering on harsh
    - i also tend to talk really fast making people think that i'm always in a hurry but it's helpful for this project so let's get going
    - there are also some that think i really have my life together just because they see my bullet journal and see the scheduling
    - but what do you think i do in my free time?
    - I mean by the editing of this video alone, you've already made assumptions about who i am
    - Now let's throw those assumptions out the window
- Aural Analysis
    - so you already know, my name is maisie tan. i'm a non-major who's currently under engineering. i used to be in computer science lured in by the lie that computer science leads to game development
    - so yeah, you heard that right i was planning to go into game development, that's because *drum roll* i like games... wow what a surprise.
    - other stuff i like include anime, which i watch A LOT, musicals, which comprise 90% of my song library and stationery, which populate my already full desk. like seriously, i have drawers upon drawers of stickers and washi tape and i love it
    - my hobbies right now are filming videos for my youtube channel, where i post weekly videos about studying, games and other stuff i'm interested in.
    - speaking of other stuff i'm interested in, i also like crafitng and cosplay. with those skills i've made full costumes like a female version of the disney captain hook and also azula from avatar. but also, i've made smaller things like these custom hair pins for an event and these earrings which are part of a costume
    - in terms of instruments i play, i can play the piano, guitar, ukulele, drums, kalimba just prefacing this saying that i can't play any of them well... i also sing but that's a separate matter
- Cultural Consideration
    - If you've seen my last name, it's Tan, you probably assumed that I was chinese. and you would be right
    - i started in a chinese school until grade 2, homeschool from grades 3-6 then a christian school for all of highschool
    - singing was a part of my family ever since i was young, but i was enrolled in piano lessons at 8, went til i was 10. tried to learn drums in grade 5, was taught guitar in highschool and taught myself how to play the ukulele and kalimba when i got into senior high
    - i've always had a particular interest in singing, but it was usually in the context of musicals and acting rather than choir or classical singing. didn't get any training for it either. i just do it for fun.
    - i hope this gave you guys an idea of who i am and my music background as not a music major. Thanks for watching!

yes, i changed my hair
