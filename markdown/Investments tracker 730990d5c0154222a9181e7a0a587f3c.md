# Tutorial

This template will help you keep track of your investments. I create a new copy of it every year, so I can keep track of how my investments are going each year.

Add each investment you have as a row in the **Investments** table. Fill the fields as follows:

- **Type**: type of investment, for example national treasury, investment fund, stocks, etc.
- **Name**: an identifier that will let you know which investment this refers to.
- **Investment date**: The day on which you began this investment.
- **Invested amount**: The amount of money you put into the investment.
- **Liquid value (2018)**: How much that investment was worth on Dec 31st, 2018. Rename and review this field every new year.

The other fields will be filled automatically. Remember to rename the fields that refer to specific years if you create new copies of the template.

To keep track of the investment during the year, create new rows in the **Returns** table filling in the following fields:

- **Name**: Use it as you prefer.
- **Date**: The date when you checked the investment status.
- **Related investment**: The row from the **Investments** table that this row refers to.
- **Current**: ****How much your investment is worth today.

If everything is correct, you'll see the remaining fields of the **Investments** row filled, showing you interesting stats about your investments!
