- Lost of time and money
- Lost of reputation or business
- Reputation

### What is Software Testing?

- Test Planning
- Test Execution
- Test Design
- Test Analysis
- Test Implementation
- Reporting
- Evaluation

## Dynamic Vs. Static

**Static testing** you are testing a product without the system running such as peer reviews, code reviews. A way of reviewing the system, before all the phases doing a formal review. 

**Dynamic testing:** ee

## Testers vs Developers

| Testers | Developers |
| --- | --- |
| Initial test | Perform debugging |
| Final confirmation test | Can perform related component testing |
| SDLC
   - Perform debugging
   - Test component |  |

## Testing principles

1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not thei abscence
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing saves time and money
4. Defect cluster together
5. Beware of the pesticide paradox
6. Abscence of defects is a fallacy

## Recommendations

- Minimize code usage
- Maintain tests for consistency
- Keep tests simple
- Improve test structure
    - Arrange
    - Act
    - Assert
    

## Non-functional testing

1. Automated performance testing
    1. Reponse time
    2. Load testing
    3. Stress testing
    4. Peak load failure
    5. Caching / Compression
2. Security testing
    1. Session timeout
    2. Secure pages and transitions (SSL)
    3. Restricted pages and files
3. Interface testing
    1. Behavior
    2. Web-server
4. Database testing
    1. Response testing
    2.
